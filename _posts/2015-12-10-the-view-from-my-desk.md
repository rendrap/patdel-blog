I have been traveling a lot in the last week or so since my last post, so it has been a challenge getting some time to put together a nice, coherent post.  But I have definitely learned a lot about the startup scene in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou that I look forward to writing and posting some fascinating new info here.

For now, I’m taking a bit of time to sit and schedule my factory visits next week in Shenzhen and Guangzhou.  Here’s the view from my desk.
